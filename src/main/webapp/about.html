                StudyU provides college and university students an easy way to
                meet others in their courses, ask questions, and share resources. Unlike many
                of the current applications, StudyU encourages the formation of small groups of
                students who are in the same course taught by the same professor in order to foster
                a more personal connection between group members, regardless of whether they choose to work
                purely virtually or supplements their in-person meetings with StudyU. Additionally, StudyU
                was created by a group of current college and university students from diverse areas of the United States.
                <br><br>
                The original idea for this application came from Dr. Ben Reed of the San Jos√© State University
                Computer Science Department, who wanted to help and encourage students in his Operating Systems course
                to work together to solidify their grasp of his lecture material and exercises.
                <br><br>
                The creation of this application would not be possible without the help and support of
                our project advisor, Pandi Appavu, and the rest of the Google CodeU Staff during Spring of 2019, who
                consistently motivated and supported our group in learning new web development fundamentals and apply them as creatively
                as possible.
