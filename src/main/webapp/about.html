            <p style="color:white;font-size:12px;margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px;">
                StudyU, a web app developed by college students in
                the United States, provides college students an easy way to
                meet others in their courses, ask questions, and share resources. Unlike many
                current applications, StudyU encourages the formation of small groups of
                students in the same course taught by the same professor. This fosters
                a close connection between members, regardless of whether their collaboration is
                purely virtual or supplemented with in-person meetings.

                <br><br>
                The idea for this application came from Dr. Ben Reed of the San Jos√© State University
                Computer Science Department. He wants to help and encourage students in his Operating Systems course
                to work together in small groups outside of class to solidify their grasp of his lecture material and exercises.
                <br><br>
                The creation of StudyU would not be possible without the support of
                our project advisor, Pandi Appavu, and the Google CodeU Staff during Spring '19, who
                consistently motivated and supported our group during design and development.
