                Molly is a new student at San José State University.
                She sits in a large lecture hall for her biology class, trying hard
                to understand the structure of a plant cell. Since she is new, she doesn't know anyone, but
                would like to meet some other students to review and discuss the material and her questions.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h3 style = "color:#eae672;font-size:15px;margin-left:70px;margin-right:70px;font-style:italic"> Solution </h3>
            <br>
            <p style="color:white;font-size:13px;margin-left:15px;margin-right:15px;">
                Luckily for Molly, she can log onto StudyU and use the "Find a Group" feature to search for and
                join any available study group created for the course and professor she has. If one is not immediately available,
                she can express interest in a group and will be added to one as soon as possible. Now, Molly has a
                small community that can support her studies, a place to ask her questions, and access to relevant resources
                shared by members of her group.

                Philip is in his calculus class, and after talking to his fellow classmates, has noticed many of them would
                like to be able to work with others on problems outside of class, but have not formed any official group.
                He would also like to be part of a study group.

            <h3 style = "color:#eae672;font-size:15px;margin-left:70px;margin-right:70px;font-style:italic"> Solution </h3>

            <p style="color:white;font-size:13px;margin-left:15px;margin-right:15px;">
                What does he do? Philip logs onto StudyU, uses the "Create a Group" to create his calculus study group,
                and gets his fellow classmates to log on and join his group so they can work together on problems, arrange
                times to meet, and share helpful resources that will help them with their upcoming exam.
